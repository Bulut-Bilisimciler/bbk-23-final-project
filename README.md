# Cloud Computing Camp 2023 End Project Repository

Welcome to the repository for the Cloud Computing Camp 2023 end project! This project is a unique opportunity for participants to address a real-world challenge in the industry by leveraging cloud computing technologies. The primary criterion for the success of your project is its potential to solve a significant problem in the sector and, when developed further, to become a product usable and recognized by TT (Turk Telekom).

## Project Description

The Cloud Computing Camp 2023 end project focuses on innovatively addressing a specific problem observed by the participants within their respective domains. The key emphasis is on automating manual processes, optimizing workflows, or centralizing data in a cloud environment. To highlight, consider the example scenarios presented during the morning session, such as "Nöbetçi Otomasyonu" and "Certman." These services showcase the power of automation, eliminating manual tasks, or consolidating information in a centralized hub.

## Your project should

- **Identify a Industry-Specific Problem**: Clearly articulate the industry or sector-related problem your project aims to solve. This could be a manual, time-consuming process, a data management challenge, or an inefficiency in the current workflow.
- **Innovative Approach**: Demonstrate your innovative approach to solving the identified problem. This could involve the use of advanced cloud services, novel algorithms, or creative integration of technologies to provide a unique solution.
- **Cloud-Centric Scenario**: The project should be presented in a scenario within the Bulut Bilisimciler (BB) environment. Showcase how your solution operates seamlessly in a cloud setting, taking advantage of cloud scalability, security, and flexibility.
- **Potential for Productization**: Clearly outline how your project, when further developed, has the potential to become a product. Consider scalability, user-friendliness, and the broader market applicability of your solution.

## Key Features

- **Automation**: Showcase how your project automates a specific process, reducing manual intervention and improving overall efficiency.
- **Centralization**: If applicable, demonstrate how your solution centralizes data or processes, providing a unified and easily accessible platform.
- **Scalability**: Highlight the scalability of your project, indicating its potential to handle increased demands and complexities.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: If applicable, incorporate a user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience.

## Technologies Used

You can use any programming language, framework or tool that plays an important role in your project. **You should use Docker and Kubernetes because we use docker containers for every scenario**

- [Certman](https://github.com/Bulut-Bilisimciler/certman)
- [Shift Service](https://github.com/YunusEmreAlps/go-shift-service)

## Scenario Template

The scenario template includes guidelines and prompts to help users structure their scenarios and ensure that they cover all the necessary aspects. The template is flexible and can be used for different types of scenarios, such as CTF, quizzes, or tutorials. It also includes sections for diagrams, code snippets, or other relevant materials that can enhance the scenario's clarity and usefulness.

To use the scenario template, users can clone the template linked below and edit the template file according to their needs. They can then submit their scenarios to the Cloud Computing platform for review and publication. By contributing scenarios to the platform, users can help build a rich and diverse collection of resources for learning and collaboration.
